# know-flow

The know-flow library is a way to query linked data in a modular way.

Usually, implementing a sw process based on a data source involves writing some (possibly complex) queries to extract some data and then implement the logic to visualize or perform actions based on the data. Modular front-end frameworks organize the logic in blocks but usually do not offer modularity for query design. know-flow enables to decompose queries in smaller fragments which are associated to corresponding pieces of logic.
