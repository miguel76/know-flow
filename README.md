# know-flow
Library to query a knowledge graph (aka linked data source) in a data-flow-oriented
template-like way.
It enables the development of data-aware modules which encapsulate both query and data-consuming logic. 
It is based on SPARQL (standard query language for linked data), but its knownledge is not needed for most of the features.
It can be potentially used to generate any kind of data structure. 
The library know-flow-react allows to use the paradigm in React.
